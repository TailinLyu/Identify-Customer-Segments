# Identify-Customer-Segments
The third project of Udacity "Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow", data offered by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution.

## Installation

The repo contains a readable .html report. If you are interested in running the original code, you need to ask permission from Arvato for data included in the .ipynb file.

## Motivation

Identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 

## Result

Cluster 16 is overrepresented in the above graph, and Cluster 14 is underrepresented. From the comparision of two clusters, we can infer:

ALTERSKATEGORIE_GROB: Estimated age based on given name analysis, is a factor that the mail-order company that focuses on since it has a much higher value in 16 compared to 14.

WEALTH: Wealth is more strengthened in the customer data but less weighted in mail-order company, or say it is unpopular.
